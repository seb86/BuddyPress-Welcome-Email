Welcome your new buddies to your social network with a welcome email along with their login credentials.

= Contributing =
You can [contribute code](https://github.com/seb86/Welcome-Buddy/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to this plugin via the [GitHub](https://github.com/seb86/Welcome-Buddy/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) repository and localizations via [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/welcome-buddy/).

= Forum Support and Issue Reporting =
Use the WordPress.org forum for [community support](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/welcome-buddy). As this is a free plugin I can not provide support but I will do my best to respond. You are most likely to get a response from a none developer.

You may also find that a topic similar to yours has already been posted so join in rather than creating a new support ticket with the same issue.

If you spot a bug within the plugin, you can of course log it as an [issue](https://github.com/seb86/Welcome-Buddy/issues) on Github where I can act upon it more efficiently.

= Leave a Review =
Reviews are helpful to other users and this plugin reputation. Please consider spending a minute or two leaving a [review](https://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/welcome-buddy?rate=5#postform) and tell me what you think about the plugin. It matters a lot and is most appreciated.

> #### PHP Requirement
> This plugin requires PHP version 5.3 or higher.<br />
> If you're still at PHP 5.2, it's time to update. [Read here why and how](http://www.wpupdatephp.com/update/)<br />
> Updating to a newer PHP version is almost always done in minutes and free of charge!
